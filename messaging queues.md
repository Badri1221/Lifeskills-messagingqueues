# Messsaging Queues
 
 ## Introduction
     

           A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored on the queue until they are processed and deleted. Each message is processed only once, by a single consumer. Message queues can be used to decouple heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky workloads.

## Why Messaging Queues are used :

        Message queues provide communication and coordination for these distributed applications. Message queues can significantly simplify coding of decoupled applications, while improving performance, reliability and scalability. You can also combine message queues with Pub/Sub messaging in a fanout design pattern.

  ## What is Enterprise Messaging Bus

      An enterprise service bus (ESB) is a software platform used to distribute work among connected components of an application. It is designed to provide a uniform means of moving work, offering applications the ability to connect to the ESB and subscribe to messages based on simple structural and business policy rules.
